    <h3>Global Islands Database</h3>
    <p>
      Welcome to the Global Islands Database! This innovative online
      editing and validation tool allows you to contribute your
      expertise and local knowledge to the global island community.
      Your input will help to improve our understanding of the
      spatial extent and interactions between islands, their unique
      flora and fauna and the challenges they face from threats
      including climate change and invasive species. This tool forms
      part of our work under the Better Data, Better Decisions
      Initiative.
    </p>

    <p>
      After registering, you can interact with the Bing ocean
      basemap by panning, zooming and selecting islands. You can
      then review, edit, and update the spatial and attribute data
      associated with the island, thereby improving its resolution
      and accuracy at local scales.

    <h4>About the dataset</h4>
    <p>
      The Global Islands Database, a global vector
      layer of islands, is housed and maintained by UNEP World
      Conservation Monitoring Centre, Cambridge, UK
      (www.unep-wcmc.org). The Global Islands Database is originally
      based on Open Street Map (using a 1:75,000 Landsat product from
      the US National Geospatial - Intelligence Agency) and has been
      substantially refined through the work of a number of
      organisations (e.g. UNEP-WCMC, Island Conservation, BirdLife
      International, RSPB, IUCN/SSC ISSG, PIER, Global Island
      Network). The Global Islands Database is an intermediate product
      that is continuously being refined by the user community.
