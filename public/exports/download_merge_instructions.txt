The Global Islands Database keeps the island geometries and the associated meta
data in separate databases.

These can both be downloaded as individual archives which are saved in the ESRI
Shapefile format.

If you wish to merge the datasets this can be done by simply extracting the
archive files and moving the "cartodb-query.dbf" file from the
"global_islands_database-attributes" folder into the
"global_islands_database-geometry" folder.

You can then open the "cartodb-query.shp" file as you normally would from the
"global_islands_database-geometry"  folder.

There is a column named 'satus' that gives you information about user interaction 
with the data. It has 3 different categories that you can style in you GIS desktop
program:

  - 'original': Original data
  - 'add': Polygon added by user
  - 'delete': Polygon deleted by user
  - 'validate': polygon validated by user
