**Please make sure you understand the licensing implications of merging these
databases before doing so.

The Global Islands Database keeps the island geometries and the associated meta
data in separate databases.

These can both be downloaded as individual archives which are saved in the ESRI
Shapefile format.

If you wish to merge the datasets this can be done by simply extracting the
archive files and moving the "cartodb-query.dbf" file from the
"global_islands_database-attributes" folder into the
"global_islands_database-geometry" folder.

You can then open the "cartodb-query.shp" file as you normally would.
